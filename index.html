                <p>
                    I'm currently a student at the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp for Web Development. Fresh out of high school i'm on my way to start making website. 
                    I've always had a passion and interest in building websites, so this class was an obvious choice. My goal is to get a job as a Jr.Web developer
                    after completing the course and start my career. Outside of coding i enjoy collecting, and reading about videogames new and old. I enjoy sports like
                    Paintball, Slacklining, and Skating.

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
